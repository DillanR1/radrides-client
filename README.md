# Attention

This project is now live on Heroku! The Client side and the API are both hosted to Heroku. Please be patient while Heroku spins up the client and connects it to the API. It may take a brief moment before the site connects. If the cars do not display after a moment, refreshing the page and navigating back to the cars page often resolves the issue. Lastly, if you would like to add a car and the image is NOT displaying make sure you are right clicking the image and copying the link address.


# radrides


"Rad Rides" is a blog-inspired website that utilizes the MERN stack. The idea of this project was to use two different models, one with full CRUD functionality and restful routing. Visually, I wanted my app to appear a little more fun than the traditional autoblog, something more interactive and visually pleasing for the end user. Any user is able to specify the year make and model of a vehicle, and add posts to vehicles. Vehicles can also be edited and deleted.



# plans for V2

The current version of "Rad Rides" is V 1.0 with plans of adding a text box for the posts, changing button sizes, and adding a carousel. The most important improvement moving forward is to add full CRUD functionality to the post model. I would also love to add an about section with further stretch goals of adding auth in future versions.


# Technologies used

MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, React, Node, JavaScript, HTML and CSS
